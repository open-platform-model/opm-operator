## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Beta prerelease line
The release-please package SHALL be configured with `versioning: prerelease`, `prerelease: true` and `prerelease-type: beta` while the operator is on its beta line. From its first beta, a prerelease line (opmodel.dev/core@v2, library, cli, opm-operator) is on the path to GA. A breaking change is still allowed during beta, but only as a `feat!` commit whose `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is the migration note the CHANGELOG shows. It advances the `-beta.N` counter and never moves the module path to a new major. Stable lines (opmodel.dev/catalogs/opm@v4 and the module fleets) keep the normal SemVer rule: a break is a new major. A core beta break that would force a catalogs/opm major needs owner sign-off. An operator `feat!` that the released cli cannot drive SHALL merge only after the cli release that can drive it, and no `Release-As:` footer SHALL hop the operator to a new minor or major (such as `1.1.0-beta.1`) during beta. Every beta GitHub Release SHALL be flagged Pre-release. Changing `prerelease-type` alone SHALL NOT be relied on to change the label of a version that already carries a suffix; a label change needs a `Release-As:` footer. GA drops the suffix: `prerelease: false` plus a visible carrier commit per package, in dependency order.

#### Scenario: Beta releases are flagged Pre-release
- **WHEN** the Release PR for `1.0.0-beta.N` is merged
- **THEN** release-please creates tag `v1.0.0-beta.N` and a GitHub Release marked Pre-release, and the image and `install.yaml` asset are published under that tag

#### Scenario: Breaking change during beta carries its migration note
- **WHEN** a `feat!:` commit whose `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer describes the migration merges on the beta line
- **THEN** the next Release PR proposes the next `-beta.N` and its CHANGELOG section shows the footer text as a breaking-change entry

#### Scenario: Operator break waits for a cli that can drive it
- **WHEN** an operator `feat!` changes behavior the newest released cli cannot drive
- **THEN** it merges only after a cli release that can drive it, ships as the next `1.0.0-beta.N`, and no `Release-As:` footer moves the operator to `1.1.0-beta.1` or any other minor or major

#### Scenario: Label flip alone keeps the old label
- **WHEN** only `prerelease-type` changes from `alpha` to `beta` while the manifest reads `1.0.0-alpha.22` and no commit carries a `Release-As:` footer
- **THEN** the next Release PR proposes `1.0.0-alpha.23`, which is why the crossing commit carries `Release-As: 1.0.0-beta.1`

#### Scenario: GA drops the suffix
- **WHEN** the config sets `prerelease: false` and a visible carrier commit lands on `main` while the manifest reads `1.0.0-beta.N`
- **THEN** the Release PR proposes `1.0.0` and the GitHub Release is not marked Pre-release
