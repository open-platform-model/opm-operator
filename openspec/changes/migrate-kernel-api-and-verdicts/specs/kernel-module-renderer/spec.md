## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Render a ModuleRelease through the kernel

`KernelModuleRenderer` SHALL acquire the module from the registry, synthesize the instance (source-carrying) with the supplied values, and render it through the single-build render with the leased platform record and the record's skew policy. Every kernel call SHALL share nothing: acquisition, synthesis and the build each evaluate in a context of their own, so renders of different objects overlap with no gate.

Values SHALL reach synthesis as a stack of values sources, each carrying an origin that identifies where the operator read it from, so a values error names that origin rather than an anonymous filename. No acquisition or synthesis call SHALL pass a per-call registry or load-options argument: the registry mapping is the one the shared Kernel was constructed with.

#### Scenario: Renders resources from a materialized platform

- **WHEN** `RenderModule` is called for a resolvable module while a generated platform is recorded
- **THEN** the result carries the rendered resources and inventory entries, and any warnings the render reported

#### Scenario: Values are applied when supplied

- **WHEN** non-nil `RawValues` are passed
- **THEN** they are supplied to instance synthesis as a values source whose origin names the CR field they came from
- **AND** when no values are supplied the module's `#config` defaults apply

#### Scenario: A values error names its origin

- **WHEN** the supplied raw values violate the module's `#config` schema
- **THEN** the render fails with an error naming the origin the operator gave that source, not an anonymous filename

### Requirement: Adapt compiled output to operator resources

The renderer SHALL adapt the single-build render's compiled objects — the kernel's own compiled-output type, declared beside the render verb — to operator resources and inventory entries exactly as before.

The render SHALL report no message strings. The renderer SHALL compose the result's warnings itself from the render's advisory diagnostic rows: the unhandled-trait table, and the resolved-versions rows marked newer. Each composed warning SHALL name the same facts as before — for skew, the OPM-namespace path, the version the module requires and the version the platform carries; for an unhandled trait, the component and the trait.

#### Scenario: Compiled item maps to a resource

- **WHEN** a library `Compiled` with a value and provenance is adapted
- **THEN** the resulting `core.Resource` carries the same value, release, component, and transformer
- **AND** an inventory entry can be built from it via the existing `ToUnstructured` path

#### Scenario: One compiled-output type

- **WHEN** the operator's adapter names the type it converts from
- **THEN** it SHALL be the type the kernel package declares, and the operator SHALL NOT import a separate library package for it

#### Scenario: Warnings reach the reconciler

- **WHEN** the render reports an unhandled optional trait, or a path whose resolved-versions row is marked newer under the `Warn` policy
- **THEN** the render result carries one operator-composed warning naming that fact, and the render result carries no library-authored message string
