## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Reason constants

The status package SHALL define the reason constants used on the Ready condition, including `SkewRefused` (Ready=False: the platform's skew policy is `Refuse` and the module requires a newer catalog build than the platform pins) beside the existing `ResolutionFailed`, `RenderFailed`, `PlatformNotReady` and the Platform reasons `Generated`, `BuildFailed`, `GenerateFailed`.

#### Scenario: Reason constants available
- **WHEN** code imports `internal/status`
- **THEN** all reason constants are available as exported string constants

#### Scenario: Skew refusal reason is available

- **WHEN** a render is refused under the `Refuse` policy
- **THEN** the reconciler marks `Ready=False` with reason `SkewRefused`
